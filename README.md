# Quantum suicide and immortality

Quantum suicide is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics and the philosophy of physics.  

Most experts hold that neither the experiment nor the related idea of immortality would work in the real world. 
As a thought experiment, quantum suicide is an intellectual exercise in which an abstract setup is followed through to its logical consequences merely to prove a theoretical point.
